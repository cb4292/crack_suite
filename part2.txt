Part2 

My part 2 code uses the requests library to make repeated POST requests to the /login page using a modified Rockyou wordlist, truncated to 1000 entries, plus the password solved in Rockyou.txt wordlist (for debugging). This attack is significantly slower, running 23.504934652032354 guesses per second. To defeat this kind of attack, the login page should have a lockout for login attempts against single user names. In addition, the firewall should implement a lockout against specific IPs making high-speed login requests. This will help protect not just against brute force login attempts, but also password-spraying attacks.
